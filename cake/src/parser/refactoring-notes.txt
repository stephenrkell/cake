refactoring module.cpp: notes

1. already started the "DWARF predicates" -- use these to eliminate switch statements on DWARF tags

2. analogous "cake AST predicates"? e.g. to identify those AST nodes that are annotations, or have members

3. DWARF-walking helpers: searching down the tree, searching lexically up the tree; support searching on
structured (multi-part) names
